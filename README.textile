h1. Stateful directory scanning in Python

The enclosed module, dirscan.py, is intended for doing repeated scans of the
same directory over time, and taking action based on any changes (or lack
thereof) found there.

I use it mainly to clean up my trash directory.

See cleanup.py for an example of how I use the script.  I have cron run it
hourly.  It's designed to be extremely efficient in the use of memory and CPU,
so that it doesn't bog down the system at all during those hourly runs.
